# Gemini Review — Frontend HTML & CSS

**Reviewer:** Gemini 3 Pro
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Quality Score:** 10/10

## Summary

The implementation of the frontend HTML and CSS is excellent and fully meets all requirements. The code demonstrates a high standard of craftsmanship, particularly in accessibility (ARIA labels, focus management, reduced motion support) and maintainability (CSS variables, mobile-first architecture). All requested views and states are correctly implemented and hidden by default, ready for JavaScript integration.
