**Reviewer:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Quality Score:** 9/10

## Summary

Excellent implementation of the frontend HTML structure and CSS styling. All seven required views are implemented with proper semantic HTML, comprehensive ARIA accessibility attributes, and a clean mobile-first responsive design. The CSS is well-organized with custom properties, thoughtful design tokens, and includes support for reduced motion, high contrast modes, and print styling.
