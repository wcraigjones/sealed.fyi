# GLM Review — Phase 2, Stream H: Frontend HTML & CSS

**Reviewer:** GLM 4.7
**Date:** 2025-01-22
**Quality Score:** 9/10

## Summary

Excellent implementation of the static HTML structure and CSS styling for the sealed.fyi SPA. The implementation thoroughly meets all requirements with semantic HTML, comprehensive CSS styling, mobile-responsive design, and strong accessibility features including ARIA labels, roles, and focus states. The code is well-organized, uses CSS custom properties for maintainability, and provides a clean, minimal aesthetic with dark text on light background for high contrast.
