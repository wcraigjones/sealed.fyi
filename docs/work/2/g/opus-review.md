**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Quality Score:** 9/10

## Summary

Excellent implementation of all required shared backend utilities. All 5 modules (dynamo.js, token.js, pow.js, responses.js, validation.js) are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage (97.88% statements, 147 passing tests). The code is well-documented, follows consistent patterns, and properly handles edge cases.
