# Gemini Review — Shared Backend Utilities

**Reviewer:** Gemini 3 Pro
**Date:** 2024-01-25
**Quality Score:** 10/10

## Summary

The shared backend utilities have been implemented excellently. The code structure is clean, modular, and robust, with comprehensive test coverage (approx. 98%). All required modules (`dynamo`, `token`, `pow`, `responses`, `validation`) are present and implement the specified functionality correctly, including strict security practices like `Cache-Control: no-store` and proper cryptographic random generation.
